                <br />
                <p>Visitors may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages.

                <p>4UImg respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:contact@4uimg.com">contact@4uimg.com</a>.</p>

                <p>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</p>

                <br />
                <p>4UImg attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, 4UImg does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any 4UImg service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by 4UImg itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.</p>

                <br />
                <p>PRICING</p>

                <br />
                <p>Except where noted otherwise, the List Price or Suggested Price displayed for products on any 4UImg service represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice; or the estimated retail value for a comparably featured item offered elsewhere. The List Price or Suggested Price is a comparative price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day. For certain items that are offered as a set, the List Price or Suggested Price may represent "open-stock" prices, which means the aggregate of the manufacturer's estimated or suggested retail price for each of the items included in the set. Where an item is offered for sale by one of our merchants, the List Price or Suggested Price may be provided by the merchant.</p>

                <p>With respect to items sold by 4UImg, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by 4UImg is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.</p>

                <p>We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.</p>

                <br />
                <p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>

                <br />
                <p>THE 4UIMG SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE 4UIMG SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY 4UIMG ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. 4UIMG MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE 4UIMG SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE 4UIMG SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE 4UIMG SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>

                <p>TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, 4UIMG DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 4UIMG DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE 4UIMG SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE 4UIMG SERVICES, 4UIMG'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM 4UIMG ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. 4UIMG WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY 4UIMG SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY 4UIMG SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.</p>

                <p>CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</p>

                <br />
                <p>DISPUTES</p>

                <br />
                <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any 4UImg Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by 4UImg or through 4UImg.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>

                <br />
                <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Please contact 4UImg at contact@4uimg.com to initiate an arbitration request. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, 4UImg will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>

                <br />
                <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>

                <br />
                <p>APPLICABLE LAW</p>

                <br />
                <p>By using any 4UImg service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and 4UImg.</p>

                <br />
                <p>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</p>

                <br />
                <p>We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
