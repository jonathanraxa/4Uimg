                </p>
                <p><strong>By visiting 4UImg.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>What Personal Information About Customers Does 4UImg.com Gather?</strong></p>
                <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your 4UImg experience. Here are the types of information we gather.</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Automatic Information:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses 4UImg.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of 4UImg.com on other Web sites.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from 4UImg.com if your computer supports such capabilities.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>What About Cookies?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features, and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of 4UImg.com's features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any 4UImg.com products and services that require you to Sign in.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Does 4UImg.com Share the Information It Receives?</strong></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we do not share customer information with others.</span></p>
                <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>How Secure Is Information About Me?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to visit 4UImg.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California.
